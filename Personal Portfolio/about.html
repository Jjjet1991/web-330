    <p style="font-size:1em;">
      I am an aspiring web designer currently enrolled at Bellevue University. I have worked as a 
      911 call receiver and law dispatcher for the past ten years. I love books and literature and use many of the 
      famous works to help my design aesthetic. A soft romantic feel with feminine colors is a Jane Austen vibe, while 
      a masculine feel with notes of foreign influence is more of a Hemingway. </p>

        I am currently learning to sail and hope to one day travel the world by sea. I love to eat, hate to cook
       and always enjoy a cocktail. On a life long mission to be more than just a cog in the machine, I love to create new
        and exciting things and am always open to learning something new.
